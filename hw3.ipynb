    "Let's go back to our library program. You can use your solution to last weeks homework as starter code and build on it. Here is what the program should be able to do:\n",

    "\n",
    "- check out books from the library.\n",
    "- each book can be checked out only once\n",

    "- the program keeps track of who checked out a book\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment add the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if a book is not in the library, users should be able to request them to be bought\n",
    "- users can also donate books to the library\n",
    "- the library also stores the authors of books and users can query for those (e.g. enter a title and the program returns the authors)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use functions to structure your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to write this program. It is up to you how you structure interaction with it (e.g. first ask for what a user wants to do, then ask for specific inputs or try to capture all cases with one input process).\n"
